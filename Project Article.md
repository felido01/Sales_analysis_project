## **Data Analysis Steps**

### **1. Ask (Defining the Problem)**
This stage involves defining Goals and understanding stakeholder expectations from the analysis.

### **2. Data Preparation**
Data preparation was done using Google Sheets, where:
- The **profit column** was split to separate **losses** from actual profits.
- A **shipping duration column** was created by subtracting **order date** from **ship date** to analyze efficiency.

### **3. Data Cleaning & Processing**
Using **Pandas** in Python, the dataset was imported into a Jupyter Notebook for cleaning:
- Checked for **data types, missing values, and duplicates**.
- Used `.info()`, `.shape`, and `.describe()` for initial exploration.
- Ensured **date columns** and **sales-related data types** were correct.
- Conducted **further transformations** during analysis based on key metrics.

### **4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
The analysis focused on:
- **Sales & Profit Trends Over the Years**
- **Category and Sub_Category Performance Analysis**
- **Shipping Efficiency Evaluation**
- **Impact of Discounts on Profitability**
- **Regional and Customer Segment Insights**
